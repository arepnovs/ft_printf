# ft_printf
if/else magic

Mandatory part

• You have to recode the libc’s printf function.

• Your function will be called ft_printf and will be prototyped similarly to printf.

• You won’t do the buffer management in the printf function.

• You have to manage the following conversions: sSpdDioOuUxXcC

• You must manage %%

• You must manage the flags #0-+ and space

• You must manage the minimum field-width

• You must manage the precision

• You must manage the flags hh, h, l, ll, j, et z.

Also works non-existing flag %b to print in binary!!!
